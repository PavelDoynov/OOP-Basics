/*
 * 02. Creating Constructors
 * 
 * Add 3 constructors to the Person class from the last task, use constructor chaining to reuse code:
 * 
 * 1.  The first should take no arguments and produce a person with name “No name” and age = 1. 
 * 2.  The second should accept only an integer number for the age and produce a person with name “No name” and age 
 * equal to the passed parameter.
 * 3.  The third one should accept a string for the name and an integer for the age and should produce a person with the
 * given name and age.
